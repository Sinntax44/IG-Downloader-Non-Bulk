# IG-Downloader
Modified Bulk download Instagram stories

This script will download stories of a chosen user posted in the past 24 hours. A logged in Instagram account is required to use this.

# Usage
    python3 main.py

On first run, a config file will be generated. The script will ask for some web browser cookie values of a currently logged in user, which can be obtained from the developer tools of Google Chrome or Firefox.

Note that the cookies may need to be periodically refreshed at least every 3 months or else this script may not be able to sucessfully authenticate. 

To periodically obtain stories from followed users, run this script at least every 24 hours. A Windows Scheduled Task or a Unix cron job is recommended to perform this automatically.
